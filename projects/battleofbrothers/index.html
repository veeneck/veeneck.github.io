  <h1>Battle of Brothers</h1>
  
  <p>Shortly after leaving SurveyMonkey, my brother and I decided to persue a passion: Game Development! How hard could it be, right? We naively created a one year competition to see who could make the better game.</p>

<p>With excitment and motivation, we jumped right in and got to work. We even rented an office space for 2 years! And of course, we commited ourselves to documenting the journey. Enter <a href="http://battleofbrothers.com">battleofbrothers.com</a>.</p>

<p>There are too many lessons learned to cover them all here. Head on over to my <a href="http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/timeline">list of status updates</a> if you want the play by play.</p>

<h3 id="will-i-finish">Will I Finish?</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Up until October 2017, I was working on the game non stop. A hurricane came through town, which caused me to take a two week break. During that break, I realized how much unnecessary stress I was placing on myself over the game. It was also taking away the joy of programming. I would like to finish, and I still hold myself accountable for keeping builds running on new iOS versions. But, no promises, yet.</p>
