      <title>A Second Design Proposal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I submitted a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ryancampbell.blog/blog/a-design-proposal/&#34;&gt;first stab at a redesign for a local charity&lt;/a&gt;. As expected, this was way too much of a change. I learned quickly that a basic round of discussion is needed before jumping into a project. I&amp;rsquo;m still happy I practiced on the last design, but it turns out they&amp;rsquo;re looking for more of a clean, expected look. So, I ran with a look you might find in most charity templates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with a local charity to revamp their website. This has been a good project for me for a few reasons. First, as a coder, this gives me a chance to workout some design muscles. Second, as someone who normally answers only to myself, this gives me a chance to pitch to a group and understand their needs and wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Lot Changes in Five Years</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently offered to create a website for a local charity, and then it hit me &amp;ndash; I haven&amp;rsquo;t made a website in five years. Sure, I made this site and got on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ryancampbell.blog/blog/i-m-late-to-the-jamstack-party/&#34;&gt;decentralized bandwagon&lt;/a&gt;, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t done something from scratch in some time. Especially on the design and responsive front. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m finished, I thought it may be useful to share my notes.&lt;/p&gt;
