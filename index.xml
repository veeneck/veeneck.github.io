      <description>&lt;p&gt;For awhile now, my wife and I have had the idea of a smart photo wall. Something that could schedule screen savers, sync across multiple displays, etc. We love documenting memories, and we wanted an elegant way to display them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shortly after leaving SurveyMonkey, my brother and I decided to persue a passion: Game Development! How hard could it be, right? We naively created a one year competition to see who could make the better game.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog serves the purpose of tracking my progress, and acts as a test bed to leanr new concepts. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep a directory of those projects here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amanda and I have a goal of becoming more involved over the next two years. I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to update this space documenting the types of contributions we can make.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just when I thought my publishing setup was finalized, I stumbled across &lt;a href=&#34;https://forestry.io&#34;&gt;Forestry&lt;/a&gt;. Forestry appears to solve my GUI wishlist all at once. GUI for Hugo? Check. Well designed for clients? Check. Can be mapped to my URL? Check. Well supported and documented? Check.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Publishing a Decentralized Blog</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The promising aspect of Beaker is that all web technologies work as expected. The fact that visting a site is as simple as creating an &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; and placing &lt;code&gt;dat&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; in front of the URL is a great start. The trickier aspect is teaching yourself to think in terms of a static, shared infrastructure instead of a central one. No database means that a static CMS is needed to manage the blog.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decentralized Web : First Impressions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/its-time-to-rebuild-the-web&#34;&gt;Time to Rebuild the Web?&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;(https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16847781)&#34;&gt;accompanying Hacker News discussion&lt;/a&gt;, I felt compelled to jump in and give &lt;a href=&#34;https://beakerbrowser.com/&#34;&gt;Beaker&lt;/a&gt; a shot. I was instantly excited. They type of excited where eight hours fly by and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to leave your computer. That said, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the appeal was from nostalgia or innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a husband, father, developer, gamer, runner and lots of other er&amp;rsquo;s. I finish some projects and attempt to finish others.
I believe writing is a hobby with benefits, so I share my thoughts here.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I credit this blog with any success I have. Chris, Kevin and I were forced to push ourselves, stick to schedules, learn to work together, and generally get inspired.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The company I started with my brother (Chris Campbell) and friend (Kevin Hale) back when I was 23. A form builder! Exciting! Still proud of it, so here is the story.&lt;/p&gt;
